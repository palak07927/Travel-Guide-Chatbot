Your Personalized Guide for the Shortest Campus Routes

This project introduces a chatbot-based navigation system specifically designed for our campus, simplifying wayfinding and enhancing user convenience. The system provides the shortest route between two points and step-by-step guidance, reducing confusion and reliance on staff for directions.

While currently tailored to our campus, the system has the potential for broader applications. It can be integrated with other technologies to serve various types of campuses, such as educational institutions, hospitals, corporate offices, or even smart city infrastructure. This adaptability highlights its scalability and future-proof design, making it a versatile solution for efficient navigation in complex environments.

By offering an interactive chatbot interface, this system ensures that navigation remains intuitive and accessible to all users, regardless of their familiarity with the location or technology. It represents a step towards creating smarter, more connected spaces, aligning with the needs of modern infrastructure and user expectations.
